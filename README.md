ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Nano.

In love with open-source, I am currently working as a software engineer, specialized mostly on backend development, but but without forgetting my needs for frontend involvement.

As a regular user and supporter of open-source, I am trying to dedicate some of my free time, in order to give back to projects I use.
