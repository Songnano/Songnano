Hello there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nano.

In love with open-source, I am currently working as a software engineer, specialized mostly on backend development, but but without forgetting my needs for frontend involvement.

As a regular user and supporter of open-source, I am trying to dedicate some of my free time, in order to give back to projects I use.

Let's build a better web, together.

I want to help you build beautiful, accessible and fast websites that work cross-browser, and for all of your users.
